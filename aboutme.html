        My name is Elena Fang and I am currently a junior at the University of Michigan in the School of Information studying Information Science with a focus on user experience and user interface design. I believe in the ability of design to create an impact . I have always had an interest in being able to create effective user interfaces which is why I have always dabbled in web design & HTML/CSS in my free time! 
            <br> <br>
            Besides that, I love traveling, hiking, exploring, listening to music, and obsessing over coffee ! In addition, I have a strong background in catering to consumers wants&needs as I have worked in customer service for over two years in a variety of different establishments. <br> <br>

            I am currently in search of an internship for summer 2020!
