        <h1>Design Thinking in Barcelona</h1>
            <b>Overview:</b> This past summer, I was able to take a design thinking course in which we designed a variety of projects. These were the highlighted projects that I completed in which I got to learn more about user empathy, user interviews, and proto-typing. <br><br>
            
            <h2>Suitcase Product Redesign</h2>

Elena, Alice, Jordan, Joseph, Zoe<br> <br>
            <b>Interviews Highlights</b>
Removable wheels so it could be repurposed for storage<br>
Organizable compartments for convenience<br>
Weight meter to track luggage weight<br>
Vacuumable compartments to increase storage efficiency <br>
Customizable section/cloth in front of the bag or handle for differentiation <br>
            <br>


            <b>Questions</b>
Can you describe the luggage pieces you currently own in three words?<br>
What do you like about the luggage you own?<br>
What are the top three things that you find frustrating about luggage?<br>
What other components do you wish your luggage could have?<br>
How do you store your luggage?<br>
What are some struggles you experience with luggages at the airport, on the way to/from airport, and on the plane?<Br><br>

            <b>Prototype ideas</b>
Collapsible luggage<br>
Resizable luggage<br>
Vacuum seal luggage<br>
Self-weighing luggage<br>
Self-cleaning luggage<br><br>

            <b>Likes:</b>
The print
Can bring computer, cables, a lot of space
Optimizing space
Can carry everything in it 
<br> <br>
            <b>Major Problems:</b>
No wheels or two wheels so it’s always falling<br>
Heavy, even when empty<br>
The material can be prone to scuffing or bumps due to mistreatment<br>
Hard to recognize bags because they’re all very similar<br>
It gets messy when you want to just take one thing out<br>
Security<br>

            <b>Storage Locations:</b>
Closet, wardrobe, in room, garage, under couch<br>
Some people think that it does take up room that they can use for other things, but other people think that their bag is small enough so that it’s not a huge issue
<br>
            <br>
            <b>Ways to Improve:</b>
Extra compartments<br>
Organized compartments that are item-specific<br>
Lightweight<br>
Durable wheels<br>
More space<br>
Want it to become smaller somehow<br>
Want more secure way to close suitcase<br>
Traveling<br>
Find bags that fit in the car<br>
Falling over<br>
Lost luggage/waiting for luggage<br>
Walking around the city is difficult<br>
Too Big/unable to carry<br>
Difficult to get items out because they are all in one big space<br><br>
            <b>Bag Ideas:</b>
Vacuum technology<br>
Weight meter <br>
More compartments that are item-specific <br>
Removable wheels so that the suitcase can be repurposed for storage<br>
Optional sizes<br>
Customizable handle/cloth to differentiate<br>
Foldable/compressible bag<br>

            <h2>Bath Mat Product Redesign</h2>

            <b>Overview:</b>
We were given a task to find a daily household item or service and redesign its service based on user feedback. This was a quick project developing user interviewing and user empathy skills developed in my month-long, 3 credit study abroad course in Barcelona called Design Thinking. This was a project done by a team of 4 other people.
<br> <br>
            <b>Timeline:</b>
3 days

            <b>Contributions:</b>
User research, prototyping<br>
<br>
Goals:<br>
Create a product that solved the primary issues people found with a daily shower experience.<br><br>

Interview Questions:<br>
Can you describe the perfect getting out of shower experience?<br>
Can you describe how you get out of a shower?<br>
Follow up -- what are some struggles you face?<br>
Follow up (maybe) what do you think causes these struggles?<br>
Have you ever slipped while stepping out of the shower?		<br>
Describe your current bath mat.<br>
Just a towel? Expensive rug that stays dry? Does it cover a good portion of the area? Plush? Soft? Warm and often damp? Green? Faded?<br>





What do you think the purpose of the bath mat is?<br>
Have you thought of a bath mat with other functionalities such as blow drying mat or heat up mat?<br>
Which would you likely use it? Why?<br>
What could you improve about your current bath mat?<br><br>

            <b>Feedback:</b><br>
Many people struggle with the coldness when getting out of the shower<br>
People dislike having wet floors despite the mat<br>
Functionality and cost matter more than aesthetic<br>
Using different fabrics/materials/shapes<br>
Stick to the ground so it doesn’t move around<br>
Hygiene is an issue<br>
Doesn’t dry quickly/ annoying to clean or dry<br>
            <br>

            <b>Redefine Prototype </b><br>
From our feedback, we realized that our target audience was not truly interested in a dryer mat. It was not very functional in the quick time that it takes for them to get out of the shower. The excess water left on floors as well as the texture that they personally preferred was more important. With this in mind we pivoted to focusing more on functionality and affordance.
<br><br>
Make your own mat <br>
Multiple layers <br>
Hygienic silicone bacteria resistant porous layer<br>
Non-Slip Bottom Layer<br>
PopSocket sticky bottom layer for non-slip rugs<br>
Flex Tape (waterproof, bond increases with time)<br>
Top Layer options<br>
Thick plush extra absorbent top layer<br>
Thin towel like (for those who prefer simplicity)<br>
Memory foam<br>
Choose color? Possibly add text?<br>
Optional Additional Layers<br>
Heated layer 
<br><br>

            <b>Prototype 2:</b>
Our target audience is people with shared bathrooms or those who have their own homes or apartments. Typically being well established, such as individuals who are 30-years-old and older. <br><br>

            <b>Conclusion</b><br>
Our final design is a bath mat with 3 different layers. The first layer will be a removable layer where each customer can customize it to their own features, such as whether the mat is memory foam (for comfort), thin (for simplicity), heats up (for warmth), has essential oils (to prevent bacterial growth), pink, blue, etc. Since the first layer is removable, it also allows it to be washed easily. The second layer is a layer of porous silicon where excess water from the first layer can drain down into the second layer. This allows the first layer to dry quicker since water is not sitting in the first layer. The silicone allows the second layer to be cleaned easily and the water will seep down to the third layer, which is made of flex tape. With the water sitting in the third layer, flex tape will create a watertight seal with the floor, which prevents the mat from slipping and moving after one gets out of the shower.
<br><br>
The second and third layers are permanently attached and it works better because it incorporates the idea of not having one universal product, but also having add ons. This way, the first layer can easily be replaced when it gets moldy, allowing the second and third layers to be kept, cleaned, and reused by the customer while the customer changes the top layer. This also allows different people of the same household to replace the top layer to their preference when they shower.
